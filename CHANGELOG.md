# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

The `junaidbhura/composer-wp-pro-plugins` repository has been abandoned.
The `wp-jazz/composer-wp-pro-plugins` repository will serve as the continuation
of the Composer plugin.

For more information about this change, please read "[Should this plugin exist?](https://github.com/junaidbhura/composer-wp-pro-plugins/issues/69)".

#### For Composer users

The next time users interact with `composer`, users will be notified
that `junaidbhura/composer-wp-pro-plugins` is abandoned with a suggestion
to use `wp-jazz/composer-wp-pro-plugins`.

To switch to the new Composer plugin:

1. In your `composer.json` file, replace occurrences `junaidbhura/composer-wp-pro-plugins`
   with `wp-jazz/composer-wp-pro-plugins`.
2. Optional; rename the vendor of repository definitions for WordPress plugins.
   For example, replace `junaidbhura/gravityforms` with `wp-jazz/gravityforms`.
	* The new Composer plugin will remain backwards compatible with WordPress plugins
	  that continue to use the `junaidbhura/*` vendor name after transitioning to
	  new the package.
3. Execute `composer update wp-jazz/composer-wp-pro-plugins` to install
   the package into the `vendor/` directory and update the `composer.lock` file.

#### For contributors

Users using a git clone will need to update the clone address
from `git@github.com:junaidbhura/composer-wp-pro-plugins.git`
to `git@github.com:wp-jazz/composer-wp-pro-plugins.git`.

* Contributors will need to fork the new repo and add both the new fork as well as
  the new repository as remotes to their local git copy of `composer-wp-pro-plugins`.
* Users who have (valid) open issues or pull requests in
  the `junaidbhura/composer-wp-pro-plugins` repository are invited to resubmit these
  to the `wp-jazz/composer-wp-pro-plugins` repository.

* Add EditorConfig to enforce consistent coding styles and PHPStan to identify coding issues (@mcaskill wp-jazz/composer-wp-pro-plugins#4).
* Throw an error if we download the incorrect version of Gravity Forms (@mcaskill wp-jazz/composer-wp-pro-plugins#3).

### Changed

* Improve error reporting and logic for handling downloads (@mcaskill wp-jazz/composer-wp-pro-plugins#2).
* Decouple vendor name for WordPress Plugins to support `wp-jazz/*` and `junaidbhura/*` for backwards compatibility.
